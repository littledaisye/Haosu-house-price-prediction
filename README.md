Haosu House Price Prediction
===========================

This project consists of a machine learning model and a web application for house price prediction.

1. Machine Learning Model
-------------------------
The machine learning model is built using Python and leverages various libraries, such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and xgboost. The purpose of the model is to predict house prices based on several features.

To use the machine learning model, follow these steps:
- Install Python (version 3.10.4 or higher).
- Install the required Python packages by running the necessary commands.
- Run the Python script for the machine learning model.
- The Python script involves are MachineLearning.ipynb and TestSet.ipynb.

2. House Price Prediction Dashboard
-----------------------------------
The House Price Prediction Dashboard is a web application that allows users to visualize and analyze house price data. It provides insights into factors that influence house prices, including the year of sale, year built, lot area, house style, and neighborhood. Users can make informed decisions about purchasing houses based on their preferences.

To use the House Price Prediction Dashboard, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract its contents.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Start the dashboard using the provided command.
- Access the dashboard through a web browser at `http://localhost:8050`.
- Explore the various visualizations and insights on the dashboard.
- Customize the dashboard or add additional features by modifying the `app.py` script.

3. Data
-------
The House Price Prediction Dashboard utilizes house price data stored in the `train.csv` file. Ensure that you provide the correct path to the data file in the `app.py` script.
